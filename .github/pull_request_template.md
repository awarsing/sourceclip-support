<!--
Thanks for opening a PR! A few quick checks before you submit:

1. Have you signed off your commits? (git commit -s)
   FeedLog uses DCO, not CLA. No form to fill out — just `-s` on every commit.
2. Does your change need a discussion first?
   For anything non-trivial, please link the Issue or Discussion that led to it.
3. Does CI pass locally? `pnpm build` is the bare minimum.
