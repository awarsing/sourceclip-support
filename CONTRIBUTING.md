# Contributing to FeedLog

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This guide covers the practical steps:
running the project locally, the kind of changes we're looking for, and how
to send a pull request.

## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — the more reproducible, the better. [Open an issue](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
- **Feature proposals** — discuss first in [Discussions](../../discussions) before writing code. Large changes without prior discussion may be redirected.
- **Documentation** — fixes to `README.md`, deploy guides in `docs/deploy/`, and inline code comments are always welcome.
- **Code** — bug fixes, new features (after discussion), tests, refactors.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **pnpm 10+** (managed via `packageManager` field in `package.json` — enable with `corepack enable`)
- **PostgreSQL 17+** with the `vector` extension. For local dev, the easiest path is the `pgvector/pgvector` Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name feedlog-pg \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=feedlog \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    pgvector/pgvector:pg17
  ```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/linkcraftstudio/feedlog.git
cd feedlog

# Install deps (postinstall runs `nuxt prepare`)
pnpm install

# Copy the env template and fill in at least DATABASE_URL and BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
cp .env.example .env

# Run migrations
pnpm migrate

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

### Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start Nuxt dev server with HMR |
| `pnpm build` | Production build for Node server preset |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `pnpm generate:migration` | Generate a Drizzle migration after schema changes |
| `pnpm migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `pnpm build:cf` | Production build for Cloudflare Workers preset |
| `pnpm deploy:cf` | Deploy the CF build via wrangler |

### Project layout

- `app/` — frontend: pages, components, composables, Pinia stores
- `server/` — backend: API routes, database, server utils, plugins
- `server/db/schemas/` — Drizzle schema (entry point: `index.ts`)
- `server/db/migrations/` — SQL migrations (generated, do not edit by hand)
- `shared/` — code importable from both frontend and backend (types, Zod schemas)
- `docs/deploy/` — self-hosting guides for the three supported platforms

## Making changes

### Before you start

For anything non-trivial, please open a [Discussion](../../discussions) or a
draft issue first. This avoids the awkward case where a PR gets closed
because the approach doesn't fit the project's direction.

### Guidelines

- **Language in code**: all identifiers, comments, commit messages, and
  user-facing strings are in English.
- **TypeScript**: strict typing. Prefer inferred types at usage sites and
  explicit types at module boundaries.
- **UI components**: shadcn-vue is installed via CLI, not manually:
  `pnpm dlx shadcn-vue@latest add <component>`.
- **Database changes**: run `pnpm generate:migration` after schema edits;
  commit both the schema change and the generated SQL.
- **No unexplained internal references**: never commit URLs, email addresses,
  or organization names that belong to an internal deployment.

### Schema & API docs

If you change `server/db/schemas/` or `server/api/` in a way that affects the
public shape of the app, please update the relevant `docs/` entry in the
same PR.

## Sending a pull request

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch: `git checkout -b fix/short-description`
2. Make your changes. Keep the scope focused — one PR per concern.
3. **Sign off your commits with DCO**: `git commit -s -m "..."`
   The `-s` appends a `Signed-off-by:` trailer, which confirms you agree to
   the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
   No CLA required.
4. Push your branch and [open a PR](../../compare) against `main`.
5. Fill in the PR template. Link the issue or discussion that motivated the
   change.
6. Make sure `pnpm build` passes locally before asking for review.

### Commit message style

Short imperative subject line, optional detailed body:

```
fix(admin): prevent duplicate board slugs on rename

The slug generator was running before the conflict check, so two admins
renaming to the same target within a few seconds would both succeed and
collide on next read. Reorder to validate after generation.
```

Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`,
`test:`) are preferred but not required.
